# Alameda_Crime_Data_Repository


In this project, I used time series method to find out the trends and patterns of Alameda county crime events from January 2012 to May 2021. Base on these data, I forecast the Alameda crime number in one year using ARIMA model. I also used T-Test and bootstrap method to test if there is any significant impact of COVID-19 on the number of Alameda crime events. At the last part, I made some heatmaps to show every crime event from the data on the map, and figured out if any cities or specific locations have more crime events, and found out any types of crime occurred more frequently in any specific locations. 

The data is downloaded from Alameda County Open Data Hub: *https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/9e459776d4c3463cad52fe6003ffc668_0/about*
